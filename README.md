# Gatsby Starter Prismic

This is a lightweight Prismic & Gatsby starter using the [gatsby-source-prismic](https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic) plugin.

I wrote a step-by-step tutorial on the making of this starter:

ðŸ‘‰ [Create a Prismic powered Gatsby site from scratch](https://ryan.warner.codes/create-a-prismic-gatsby-site/).

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/RyanWarner/gatsby-starter-prismic)

## Features

- Create pages from Prismic data source
- Render Prismic content

## Setup

1. Create a Prismic account
1. Create a Prismic repository
1. Configure custom types
1. Add Prismic schema JSONs

## Todo

There's a lot of functionality that could be added. I'm not sure how much of this should be part of this starter, vs creating other starters or Gatsby recipes.

- Images, slices
- Prismic preview
- Blog post index
- Styling?
